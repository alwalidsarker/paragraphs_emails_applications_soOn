The longest bridge in Bangladesh is the 'Padma Multipurpose Bridge'.
This dream Padma Bridge is the biggest project implemented by Bangladesh without any foreign aid. 
It is the largest project in the country and will be the longest bridge in the country after construction.
The bridge is being constructed with concrete and steel.
The length of the main bridge is 6.15 km and the width is 16.10 m. 
The bridge connecting Mawa in Munshiganj district to Jajira in Shariatpur district has two layers. 
It has a four-lane road at the top and a railway at the bottom.
The Padma Bridge will be used for rail, gas, power lines and fiber optic cable expansion in the future.
The complete design of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge was formed by a team of international and national consultants led by ECOM.
A company called China Major Bridge, a subsidiary of China Railway Group Limited, has been contracted to build the bridge.
Construction began on December 6, 2014, and by November 2020, 92% of the bridge was completed.
According to China Major Bridge Engineering Company, the contractor constructing the Padma Bridge, the Padma Bridge will be ready for traffic by April 2022.
The project will directly benefit more than 30 million people.
Although the World Bank and donors withdrew due to allegations of corruption, the Bangladesh government did not back down.
The government decided to build the bridge with its own funds and the work is progressing accordingly.
Work on the Padma Bridge is progressing at a normal pace.
Everyone concerned is hoping that the construction work of the bridge will be completed within the stipulated time.
